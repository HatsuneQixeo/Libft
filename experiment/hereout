BIGNOTE: character inside $() is treated the same as typing in terminal
NOTE: Quotation ("" / '') doesnt seem to do anything
NOTE: $ is used to specify variable name, does not go beyond space or special character except '_'
NOTE: backslash function similarly with its identity in string
NOTE: $'\n' are all treated as character

sidenote: asterisk (*) is treated as normal character
